potion
======

Vim plugin for the [potion](http://perl11.org/potion/) programming language.
Part of "[Learn VimScript the Hard
Way](http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com)" involves making your own
Vim plugin for the potion programming language and hosting it on a repositry.
Mine is here for the world to see! This also facilitates my use of
[Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim) as a Vim package manager.
